// Below are several code blocks, read them, understand them and try to find whats wrong.
// Once this exercise is finished, we'll go over the code all together and we can share how we debugged the following problems.
// Try to fix the code every time and good luck ! (write down how you found out the answer and how you debugged the problem)
// =============================================================================================================================

// === Exercise 1 ===
// Below we're defining a function, but it doesn't work when we run it.
// Look at the error you get, read it and it should tell you the issue...,
// sometimes, even your IDE can tell you what's wrong
// SOLUTION: need to define variable otherwise it won't recognize it

echo "Exercise 1 starts here:";
function new_exercise($x) {
    $block = "<br/><hr/><br/><br/>Exercise $x starts here:<br/>";
    echo $block;

}

new_exercise(2);
// === Exercise 2 ===
// Below we create a week array with all days of the week.
// We then try to print the first day which is monday, execute the code and see what happens.
// SOLUTION: Week[1] displays tuesday because array starts at 0

$week = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"];
$monday = $week[0];

echo $monday;

new_exercise(3);
// === Exercise 3 ===
// This should echo ` "Debugged !" `, fix it so that that is the literal text echo'ed
// SOLUTION: Spent 10 minutes looking before realising the wrong " were used..

$str = "Debugged ! Also very fun";
echo substr($str, 0, 10);

new_exercise(4);
// === Exercise 4 ===
// Sometimes debugging code is just like looking up code and syntax...
// The print_r($week) should give:  Array ( [0] => mon [1] => tues [2] => wednes [3] => thurs [4] => fri [5] => satur [6] => sun )
// Look up whats going wrong with this code, and then fix it, with ONE CHARACTER!
// SOLUTION: In order to be able to directly modify array elements within the loop precede $value with &.

foreach($week as &$day) {
    $day = substr($day, 0, strlen($day)-3);
}

print_r($week);

new_exercise(5);
// === Exercise 5 ===
// The array should be printing every letter of the alfabet (a-z) but instead it does that + aa-yz
// Fix the code so the for loop only pushes a-z in the array

$arr = [];
$letterLength = null;
for ($letter = 'a'; $letter <= 'z' && $letterLength < 2; $letter++) {
    $letterLength = strlen($letter);
    array_push($arr, $letter);
}

print_r($arr); // Array ([0] => a, [1] => b, [2] => c, ...) a-z alfabetical array

new_exercise(6);
// === Final exercise ===
// The fixed code should echo the following at the bottom:
// Here is the name: $name - $name2
// $name variables are decided as seen in the code, fix all the bugs whilst keeping the functionality!
// SOLUTION: implode takes glue param first, & in foreach, don't echo but return variables, -1 in count

$arr = [];
function combineNames($str1 = "", $str2 = "") {
    $params = [$str1, $str2];
    foreach($params as &$param) {
        if ($param == "") {
            $param = randomHeroName();
        }
    }
    return implode(" - ", $params);
}

function randomGenerate($arr, $amount) {
    for ($i = $amount; $i > 0; $i--) {
        array_push($arr, randomHeroName());
    }

    return $amount;
}

function randomHeroName()
{
    $hero_firstnames = ["captain", "doctor", "iron", "Hank", "ant", "Wasp", "the", "Hawk", "Spider", "Black", "Carol"];

    $heroes = [$hero_firstnames, $hero_lastnames];
    $randname = $heroes[rand(0,count($heroes)-1)][rand(0, 10)];
//    $randname = array_rand($heroes, 2);
//    echo implode($randname);
    return $randname;
}
echo "Here is the name: " . combineNames();

new_exercise(7);
// SOLUTION: echo to print, (int) to convert date string to integer
function copyright(int $year) {
    return "&copy; $year BeCode";
}
//print the copyright
echo copyright((int)date('Y'));

        return 'Welcome John';
        return ' Smith';

//do not change anything below
//should great the user with his full name (John Smith)
