// Below are several code blocks, read them, understand them and try to find whats wrong.
// Once this exercise is finished, we'll go over the code all together and we can share how we debugged the following problems.
// Try to fix the code every time and good luck ! (write down how you found out the answer and how you debugged the problem)
// =============================================================================================================================

// === Exercise 1 ===
// Below we're defining a function, but it doesn't work when we run it.
// Look at the error you get, read it and it should tell you the issue...,
// sometimes, even your IDE can tell you what's wrong
echo "Exercise 1 starts here:";
// SOLUTION: need to define variable otherwise it won't recognize it

    $x = null;
    $block = "<br/><hr/><br/><br/>Exercise $x starts here:<br/>";
    echo $block;

}

new_exercise(2);
// === Exercise 2 ===
// Below we create a week array with all days of the week.
// We then try to print the first day which is monday, execute the code and see what happens.
// SOLUTION: Week[1] displays tuesday because array starts at 0
$week = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"];
$monday = $week[0];

echo $monday;

new_exercise(3);
// === Exercise 3 ===
// This should echo ` "Debugged !" `, fix it so that that is the literal text echo'ed
// SOLUTION: Spent 10 minutes looking before realising the wrong " were used..
$str = "Debugged ! Also very fun";
echo substr($str, 0, 10);

new_exercise(4);
// === Exercise 4 ===
// Sometimes debugging code is just like looking up code and syntax...
// The print_r($week) should give:  Array ( [0] => mon [1] => tues [2] => wednes [3] => thurs [4] => fri [5] => satur [6] => sun )
// Look up whats going wrong with this code, and then fix it, with ONE CHARACTER!
// SOLUTION: In order to be able to directly modify array elements within the loop precede $value with &.
foreach($week as &$day) {
    $day = substr($day, 0, strlen($day)-3);
}
